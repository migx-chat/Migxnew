# Overview

This project is a cross-platform mobile chat application built with React Native and Expo, offering a classic chat experience with modern features. It provides real-time messaging, chat rooms, private conversations, user profiles, and social networking functionalities such as friends lists and online status. The application supports iOS, Android, and Web, incorporating room browsing, favorite management, user leveling, theme customization, and a credit transfer system. An integrated admin panel facilitates content moderation and user/room management, aiming to foster community and interaction.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend

The frontend uses Expo SDK 54, React Native 0.81.4, React 19.1.0, and Expo Router 6.x. It features a custom component library with theming (light, dark, system-auto), SVG icons, animations with React Native Gesture Handler and Reanimated, a multi-tab chat system, dynamic room management, role-based user profiles with a level system, an in-app credit system with PIN authentication, and secure authentication flows. State management is handled by React hooks and Context API.

A React + Vite admin panel (`/admin-panel`) provides management for users, rooms, abuse reports, gifts, and daily login streaks. It includes real-time statistics and JWT-based authentication, with a dark green theme and responsive design.

## Backend

The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js for RESTful APIs and Socket.IO for real-time communication. PostgreSQL (Neon DB) is used for persistent data storage, and Redis Cloud manages presence, rate limiting, and caching. The backend is structured into services for users, rooms, messages, bans, credits, merchants, and games.

### Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database includes tables for `users`, `rooms`, `messages`, `private_messages`, `credit_logs`, `merchants`, `merchant_spend_logs`, `user_levels`, `room_bans`, `game_history`, `user_blocks`, `room_moderators`, `gifts`, `audit_logs`, and `announcements`.

### Redis Usage

Redis manages online user presence, banned user lists, flood control, global rate limiting, and caching, acting as the source of truth for online/offline status. It also powers a real-time, Redis-only chatlist architecture and an in-memory feed system.

### Real-time Communication (Socket.IO)

The `/chat` namespace handles real-time events for room interactions, chat and private messages, credit transfers, and game interactions. Private messages are exclusively handled via Socket.IO.

### Notification System

Real-time notifications use Redis for persistence and Socket.IO for instant delivery. Notifications are stored in Redis with 24-hour TTL (`notif:{username}`) and emitted via socket events (`notif:gift`, `notif:comment`, `notif:follow`, `notif:credit`). The frontend listens for these events to play sounds and update the notification badge immediately without requiring logout/login.

### Game and Economy Systems

The application includes an XP & Level System, a Merchant Commission System, an Auto Voucher system for credit codes, and a Daily Login Streak System with credit rewards.

### Game State Management

Each room can have only ONE game type active at a time. The `gameStateManager` service tracks the active game type per room using Redis key `room:{roomId}:activeGameType`. When a bot is added to a room, it sets the active game type. When removed, it clears it.

**Game Types:**
- `dice` - DiceBot game (commands: `!start`, `!j`, `!join`, `!r`, `!roll`, `!cancel`)
- `lowcard` - LowCard game (commands: `!start`, `!j`, `!d`)
- `flagbot` - FlagBot/Legend game (commands: `!fg`, `!b [group] [amount]`)

**Command Routing:**
- Exclusive commands (`!d`, `!r`, `!roll`, `!fg`, `!b`) are routed ONLY to their respective game type
- Shared commands (`!start`, `!j`, `!join`, `!cancel`) are routed based on active game type
- This prevents command conflicts when multiple bots exist in different rooms

### Merchant Tagging System

Merchants can tag users with exactly 5000 COINS game-only credits. Tagged credits are consumed before regular credits when playing games (LowCard, FlagBot, Dice). A 2% commission is generated on tagged credit spending, split equally between merchant (1%) and tagged user (1%). Commissions mature after 24 hours and are automatically paid out via hourly background job. Key tables: `merchant_tags`, `merchant_tag_spends`, `merchant_tag_commissions`. API endpoints: `/api/merchants/tag/:userId`, `/api/merchants/tags/:userId`, `/api/merchants/untag/:tagId`.

### Security Features

The system incorporates eleven layers of security: strict server-side validation, Redis rate limiting, robust error handling and logging, Redis distributed locks, idempotency tracking, PIN attempt limiting with cooldowns, enhanced error message sanitization, JWT token expiry management, server-side amount authority, an immutable audit log, and device binding to prevent token theft. A centralized logger with data masking prevents data leakage while maintaining audit capability across various logging levels (INFO, WARN, SECURITY, ERROR).

### Production Configuration

Required environment variables for production deployment:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `NODE_ENV` | Set to `production` for production mode | Yes |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Strong secret key (min 32 characters) for JWT signing | Yes |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins | Recommended |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string with SSL | Yes |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis Cloud connection string | Yes |

Production security features:
- JWT secret validation: Server refuses to start if secret is missing or too short
- CORS restriction: Only whitelisted origins allowed in production
- Rate limiting: Login (10/15min), Register (5/hour), OTP (5/10min)
- SSL certificate validation: Enabled for database connections
- Schema auto-init: Disabled in production (use migrations)
- Error sanitization: Detailed errors hidden from users in production
- Production logging: Backend uses `logger.info()` (only logs in development), frontend uses `devLog()` (only logs when `__DEV__` is true) - no sensitive data exposed in production
